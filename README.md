# 1.     Overview
Hall Admission System is our solution for allocating residence rooms for local and non-local students of the City University of Hong Kong. The current hall allocation is not transparent in the admission process and is more qualitative rather than quantitative. Our solution brings forth an effective way to process the quantitative value of student applications.
